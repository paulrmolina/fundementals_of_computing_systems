# Fundamentals of Computing Systems

## Intro
The machine in Fundamentals of Computing Systems is designed to teach beginning
students how computers work. I want to revisit it to work on my fundamental
skills, and will try to take it a step further and abstract the computer
designed in the book in my own way, taking diagrams and text as reference on
what to build.

There's already one provided by the authors, but this is my own interpretation.

## Goals
1. Create a functional machine
1a. Create a physical layer
1b. Create a logical layer
1c. Create a way to emulate the machine turning on
